# Tides of Revival

Tides of Revival, or Tides for short, is, put as succinctly as possible, a Massive ImSim. Well, it isn't that _yet_. But that's the ambition.

## Hills

To _get there_, we work on it in terms of releases, called Hills. A hill is not just an improvement in terms of features and amount of content, as though we simply continued to churn on the game along some vector towards a goal in the far distance. It is also an opportunity for us to choose a specific, temporary direction, and a promise that we will create something solidified and game-like.

Towards the end of each hill we will allow ourself the time, energy, and fun, to polish it up into something that is a playable whole, even if it means some of it will get torn down again as we start working towards the next hill. One hill at a time! (But with some foresight).

On a technical level, we will also allow ourselves a bit of engineering slack and to build up some tech debt, when implementing new experimental, exploratory systems and features. By adding hacky code that's easy to tear down, we aren't needlessly spending time thinking of the perfect architecture before we know what the problem is. In between two hills, we can spend some time looking at existing debts and decide which ones are ripe for paying off.
